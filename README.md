# JavaScript to TypeScript Transition

## Repository Overview

This repository demonstrates the transition from JavaScript to TypeScript using JSDoc for type annotations. The main objective is to add type safety to a JavaScript codebase without installing TypeScript or changing file extensions.

## Steps Completed

1. **Repository Setup**:
    - Created a new repository with two branches: `main` and `develop`.
    - Added a brief README file describing the repository.

2. **Branch Creation**:
    - Created a new branch `feature/js-to-ts` from `develop`.

3. **JavaScript Code Addition**:
    - In the `feature/js-to-ts` branch, created a file `index.js`.
    - Added 200 lines of JavaScript code to `index.js`.

4. **Type Annotations**:
    - Rewrote the JavaScript code in `index.js` to include type annotations (number, boolean, string) using JSDoc comments.

5. **Commit and Merge**:
    - Committed all changes to the `feature/js-to-ts` branch.
    - Created a pull request from `feature/js-to-ts` to `develop`.
    - Merged the pull request into the `develop` branch.
